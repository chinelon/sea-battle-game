# Description
"Battleship" is a classic strategic guessing game that typically involves two players. Each player has a grid on which they place a fleet of ships without revealing the placement to their opponent. The standard fleet includes ships of different lengths, such as an aircraft carrier, battleship, cruiser, submarine, and destroyer.

The game is played on two grids, one for each player. Players take turns calling out coordinates to target a specific location on the opponent's grid, such as "B-4" or "F-7." The opponent responds with "hit" if a ship occupies that location or "miss" if it's empty water.

The objective is to strategically guess the locations of the opponent's ships and sink them by hitting every part of the ship. The first player to sink their opponent's entire fleet wins the game.

"Battleship" is known for its simplicity and requires a combination of strategy and luck, making it a popular and enduring game enjoyed by players of all ages.
